Description: Provides functions and graphics for projecting daily incidence based on past incidence, and estimates of the serial interval and reproduction number. Projections are based on a branching process using a Poisson-distributed number of new cases per day, similar to the model used for estimating R0 in 'EpiEstim' or in 'earlyR', and described by Nouvellet et al. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.epidem.2017.02.012>.
